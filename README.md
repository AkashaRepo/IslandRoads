Take me home, country roads, except it's about Orcas Island instead of west Virginia (same amount of syllables.)

One of the local Jam bands needs to do this, It will be an even bigger hit than take Walk on the Wild side.

Almost heaven, Orcas Island
Turtleback Mountain, _ _ _ _ River? (No rivers on orcas, perhaps one of the lakes?)
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Island roads, take me home
To the place I belong
Orcas Island, Salish mama
Take me home, Island roads
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water (Replace entire verse?)
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky (Something to do with overcast skies*
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye (Change the drink to something more northwest maybe?)
Island roads, take me home
To the place I belong
Oracs Island, Salish mama
Take me home, Island roads
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Island roads, take me home
To the place I belong
Oracs Island, Salish mama
Take me home, Island roads
Island roads, take me home
To the place I belong
Oracs Island, Salish mama
Take me home, Island roads
Take me home, down Island roads
Take me home, down Island roads
```

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
All my memories gather round her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
I hear her voice, in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mama
Take me home, country roads
Take me home, down country roads
Take me home, down country roads
